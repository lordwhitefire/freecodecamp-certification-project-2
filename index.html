 <li ><strong >1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season ,doubling wheat yields</li>
 <li ><strong >1953</strong> - crosses  a short , study dwarf breed of wheat with a high yielding American breed ,creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes onto provide 95% of Mexico's wheat </li>

   Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous bbecause<q >we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds</q></li>
   <li ><strong >2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95</li>
